Hello! I am a rising third-year CS PhD student at Cornell University advised by Prof. [Yoav Artzi](https://yoavartzi.com/). My research interests include learning from human feedback, compositional reasoning and multimodality. 

Before this, I did my undergraduate and master's at Stanford University (CS BS '21, CS MS '21), where I had the privilege of being mentored by [Ranjay Krishna](http://www.ranjaykrishna.com/index.html) and, through him, work with Professors [Fei-Fei Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li), [Michael Bernstein](https://hci.stanford.edu/msb/) and [Maneesh Agrawala](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~maneesh/). Outside of research, I can be found avidly consuming poetry books or improvising jazz-tinged guitar loops. I was also heavily involved with theater for much of my life.

You may contact me at mog29 at cornell dot edu
