Hello! I am an incoming CS PhD student at Cornell University, where I will be advised by Prof. [Yoav Artzi](https://yoavartzi.com/). Before this, I did my undergraduate and master's at Stanford University (CS BS '21, CS MS '21). I am excited by problems within the intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. My interests include compositional reasoning, interactive learning and self-supervised representation learning.

At Stanford, I had the privilege of being mentored by [Ranjay Krishna](http://www.ranjaykrishna.com/index.html) and, through him, work with Professors [Fei-Fei Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li), [Michael Bernstein](https://hci.stanford.edu/msb/) and [Maneesh Agrawala](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~maneesh/). Outside of research, I can be found avidly consuming poetry books or improvising jazz-tinged guitar loops. I was also heavily involved with theater for much of my life.

You may contact me at mog29 at cornell dot edu
