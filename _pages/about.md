Hello! I am a recent graduate from Stanford University (CS BS '21, CS MS '21) hoping to pursue a graduate degree. My interests reside within the intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Robotics. I am fascinated by the embodied nature of cognition and the action-perception loop in humans. Currently, my main interest is to develop agents that can learn about the visual world through self-supervised interactions; however, I'm also broadly interested in self-supervised representation learning.

At Stanford, I had the privilege of being mentored by [Ranjay Krishna](http://www.ranjaykrishna.com/index.html) and, through him, work with Professors [Fei-Fei Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li), [Michael Bernstein](https://hci.stanford.edu/msb/) and [Maneesh Agrawala](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~maneesh/). Outside of research, I can be found avidly consuming poetry books or improvising jazz-tinged guitar loops. I was also heavily involved with theater for much of my life.
